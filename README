steps:

g++ setup_plot.cpp -O3 -std=c++2a -lfmt         # compile script that generates the tikz "semilog-grid" file
./a.out                                         # run it
make                                            # run pdflatex with that template and generate the pdf
# sh scan_bode.sh
make clean_except_pdfs                          # clean working files except pdfs.
